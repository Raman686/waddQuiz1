//difference between var,let and const
//'var' is accepted all around ,as we can declare it again or we 
can assign any value to it because it will not show any error after redeclaring or updating it
for example1: let a=5;
we can also change its value to any value as a=3,a=0 or any.it will not show any 
kind of error

//"let" => it's somewhat similar to 'var',but it cannot be declare again as 
it will create errors like as:(it's already been declared), but it can be modified or changed or updated 
in other words, we can assign new values to variables instaed of redeclaring
example1 show errors if we redeclare 'a'.

//const=> const is entirely different from both,let and var.
       as it's constant.we cannot redeclare or update it.
       for example: 
                   pie= 3.14   or  22/7
                it's(pie's) value is fixed (const).
                one cannot change it's value.
